# Mini-Spotify
Made a song application  using the basic DSA concepts


Build a console-based mini Spotify using the DSA concepts that I have learned so far. It is a Playlist Manager app with:

✅ Stack: for "Recently Played" songs

✅ ArrayList: for your full playlist

✅ HashSet: to avoid duplicate songs

✅ LinkedList: for queueing songs (like upcoming songs)

✅ Recursion (optional): for things like recursive search or simulating nested folders
